# Codewars solutions

Katas divided by language and difficulty.

## Csharp

All katas solved in C# will have a **static** class named after the problem and one or more **static** methods
needed to solve it, even if they are not static in the template provided by *Codewars*. In case one of this 
methods has the same name as the kata, the method will be renamed `Solution`.

## TypeScript

TypeScript katas are organized by their difficulty. Each difficulty has an `index.ts` file that ensures all the katas pass their respective tests. Also in the root directory there is a file named `checkAll.ts` that tests all `index.ts` (8kyu, 7kyu, etc).
