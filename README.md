# Codewars solutions

Katas divided by language and difficulty.

## Csharp
All katas solved in C# will have a **static** class named after the problem and one or more **static** methods
needed to solve it, even if they are not static in the template provided by *Codewars*. In case one of this 
methods has the same name as the kata, the method will be renamed `Solution`.
